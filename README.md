cd dotfiles
make chroot
mv /keyfile /root/keyfile
exit
umount -R /mnt
reboot
```

On restart proceed with

```jshelllanguage
pacman -Sy sudo
useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash matteo
passwd matteo
visudo # uncomment wheel group
exit # login as user
git clone https://github.com/matteocrippa/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
chmod +x *.sh
make install
```

## Uninstall

```shell
cd ~/.dotfiles
make uninstall
cd ~
rm -rf ~/.dotfiles
rm -rf ~/.spells
```

## Disclaimer

As you probably know, you shouldn't just run my Makefile without reading it
first. And if you read it, you will understand that it calls other scripts like
`install.sh` which depend on `helpers.sh`. Read those, it's the only way that
you can trust what it is doing.
